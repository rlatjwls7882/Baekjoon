# [Silver I] Eli's Curious Mind

[문제 링크](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/15834) 

## 문제 설명

<p>Eli is a teenager who loves to study chemistry. She recently joined a chemistry research lab. Dr. Phil wants her to just play around with some chemicals and observe their reaction. Therefore, he gave her a one-row tray of test tubes with the different chemical inside of them and told her:</p>

<p>"Mix these chemical together anyhow that you like, but the you have to follow two rules:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Never make a mixture that has two chemicals that their tubes are next to each other.</li>
	<li>Keep adding more chmical to the mixture until it is not violating the new rule. "</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="" src="https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/15834/1.png" style="width: 247px; height: 167px; float: right;">For example, in the image you can see she was given 5 tubes and she is able to make 4 different mixture without violating the rule: {1,3,5}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {1,4}.</p>

<p>But she cannot mix 1 and 3 only because she still can add 5 without violating the rules.</p>

<p>She is curious to know how many different mixtures she can make without violating the rule with any given number of tubes. That's why she asks you write a code to calculate it for her.</p>

## 입력 

 <p>The input will consist of a sequence of numbers N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 76. Each number will be on a separate line. The input will be terminated by 0.</p>

## 출력 

 <p>Output the number of different mixture she can make without violating the rule mentioned above on a single line as show in the sample. The number of all subsets will be less than 2<sup>31</sup>.</p>
