## 문제 설명

<p>Busy Beaver calls an integer <em>timely</em> if its decimal representation has $2025$ as a contiguous substring.</p>

<p>Given an integer $N$, output any $N$-digit positive integer $X$ such that $X$ is timely <em>and</em> a perfect square. It can be shown that such an integer always exists.</p>

## 입력 

 <p>The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 997$) --- the number of testcases.</p>

<p>The only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ ($4 \leq N \leq 1000$) --- the number of digits of $X$.</p>

## 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output an $N$-digit positive integer $X$ such that $X$ is timely <em>and</em> a perfect square.</p>
