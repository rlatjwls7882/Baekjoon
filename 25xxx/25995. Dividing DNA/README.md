# [Gold II] Dividing DNA

## 문제 설명

<p>At the Bacteria And Protein Centre, you own a large collection of DNA. In fact, new strands of DNA come in all the time. To organise the vast amount of data, you identify each piece by its unique substrings: substrings that do not already occur in the database.</p>

<p>Your database can quickly determine whether a given piece of DNA occurs as a substring in the database or not. Naturally, if a certain DNA string is found in the database, it also contains all its substrings.</p>

<p>You now want to determine the <em>uniqueness</em> of a given piece of DNA: the maximal number of disjoint substrings it contains that are absent from the database.</p>

<p>You are given the length $n$ of the query string $q_1\dots q_n$, and you can repeatedly ask the database whether it contains the substring $q_i\dots q_{j-1}$.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the first sample interaction. In this case, the database contains strings "<code>TGC</code>" and "<code>CT</code>", and the query string is "<code>CTGCAA</code>". It has uniqueness $3$, because it can be split into the new substrings "<code>CTGC</code>", "<code>A</code>", and "<code>A</code>". The new substring "<code>CTGC</code>" cannot be split up further: for example, the subdivision "<code>CT</code>" and "<code>GC</code>" is not allowed, because both substrings occur (possibly as substrings) in the database. Note that the actual characters in the string are not used in the interaction.</p>

<p>You may use at most $2n$ queries to the database.</p>
