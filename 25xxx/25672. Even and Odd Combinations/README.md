# [Gold IV] Even and Odd Combinations

[문제 링크](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/25672) 

## 문제 설명

<p>Let a <em>$k$-combination out of $n$</em> be a $k$-element subset of the $n$-element set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. To denote a combination, list its elements in ascending order. For example, $2$-combinations out of $3$ look as follows: $\{1, 2\}$, $\{1, 3\}$, $\{2, 3\}$.</p>

<p>Let a combination be <em>even</em> if the number of its elements is an even number, and <em>odd</em> otherwise. For a fixed $n > 0$, consider two sets: $A_n$, the set of all even combinations out of $n$, and $B_n$, the set of all odd combinations out of $n$. It can be shown that $A_n$ and $B_n$ contain the same number of combinations.</p>

<p>For each $n = 1, 2, \ldots, 50$, your task is as follows. Construct any bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between the sets $A_n$ and $B_n$. After that, given an element of one of these sets, print the corresponding element of the other set.</p>
