[문제 링크](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/33654) 

## 문제 설명

<p>Sorting takes so long... but if we don’t mind losing some data we can sort of sort much faster!</p>

<p>A sort of sorted list is a monotonically increasing list containing all elements of another list $a$ that were originally in sorted order. That is, a sort of sorted list obtained from list $a$ contains all $a_i$ such that $a_i≥a_j$ for all $0≤j<i$.</p>

## 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a single integer $N$, the length of the unsorted list ($1≤N≤100\,000$). The next line contains $N$ space separated integers $a_i$ ($-200\,000≤a_i≤200\,000$).</p>

## 출력 

 <p>Output a single line of space separated integers representing the sort of sorted list obtained from the given list $a$.</p>
