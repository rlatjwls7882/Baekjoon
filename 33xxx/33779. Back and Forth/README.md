# [Bronze III] Back and Forth

[문제 링크](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/33779) 

## 문제 설명

<p>Steve has hit the jackpot at his local flea market. He bought a cheap scanner with a special ability: it detects palindrome words! Unfortunately the algorithm that checks the words is broken, thus Steve asked you to write a new algorithm to implement in the scanner and revive it's glory once more.</p>

<p>Remember that a palindrome word is a word that reads the same when reversed: racecar for example is a palindrome.  </p>

## 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a string s, having length $1 \leq |s| \leq 1000000$.</p>

## 출력 

 <p>Your program should output "beep" if the string s is a palindrome, "boop" otherwise.</p>
